# Day 3

## What I learned:
I learned about arrays, dictionaries, sets and enums.
Also how to access certain elements in the arrays along with key value pairs in dictionaries.
Sets are a more simple version of a array that doesn't contain duplicated data and it is unordered.
That enums are meant for specific static data like days of the week or all the months in a year etc.
Along with the associated methods with the data types like contains(), sorted(), append(), reversed(), count() etc.
