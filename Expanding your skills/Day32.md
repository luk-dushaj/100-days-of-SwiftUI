# Today I learned:

- How to make implicit animations like .scaleEffect and .animation along with using @State to modify the animation.
- More on customizing animations like .spring, .easeInOut also modifying those as well with .delay/.repeatForever.
- Also on the flexibility of bindings like I can have certain animations in a stepper or attached to a button etc.
- Then explicit animations like .rotation3DEffect along withAnimation closure, I think explicit animations are good for being more specific with the animations.
