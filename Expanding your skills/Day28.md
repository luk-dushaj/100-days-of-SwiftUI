# Today was a review/challenge day:

- I completed the review
- I also did these challenges to the BetterRest project:

## Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!
2. Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
3. Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.

Also I finally completed the Rock Paper Scissors project, it will still be under Starting with SwiftUI directory. I didn't go too ham with the design but I would say it is respectable enough for the end user. But the logic is pretty good.
