# Today I learned:

- About the List view how it is easier to use than form especially for dynamic data.
- Loading resources in my app like accessing a files content.
- Also more methods on working with strings like .rangeOfMisspelledWord, .trimmingCharacters etc. And working with Objective-c from the UITextChecker() library.
