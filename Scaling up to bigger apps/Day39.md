# Today I learned:

- Resizing images like .resizable(), ,scaledToFit(), .scaledToFill() and .containerRelativeFrame()
- ScrollView() and learned what difference between LazyVstack vs a regular Vstack
- NavigationLinks and when should I use it vs a .sheet
- Using more structs to break my data down into chunks mainly with hierarchical codable data
- Using grids along with combining it with ScrollView and creating my own layouts maining wrapping it in a array with the GridItem type also the .adaptive modifier
