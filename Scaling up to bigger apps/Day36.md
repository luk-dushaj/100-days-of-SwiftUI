# Today I learned:

- Went over the differences again between structs/classes and how I can change the properties of each in swiftui with @Observable and @State
- Learned that @Observable handles all the reinvoking and @State checks if it is changed
- The .sheet(isPresented:) method to then invoke my struct thats a view
- @Environment to also dismiss and has all other functionality like dark/light mode, timezones etc
- .onDelete and EditButton() for dynamic rows in lists
- Different ways of storing user data like UserDefaults() and @AppStorage
- The Codable protocol along with using the JSONEncoder() to convert swift properties to json
