# Today I learned:

- Using enums while conforming to CodingKey type is good for changing the JSON property while encoding *(great for predictability + readability)*
- I learned how to use and implement haptic effects like .sensoryFeedback()
- Also .impact(flexibility: soft, intensity: 0.5) inside the .sensoryFeedback() modifier for more control over the haptic feedback
- Along with seeing how the CoreHaptics library is used along with some implementations of the types
- Lastly I followed and made the first part of the CupcakeCorner app implementing the Order object and added the UI components like toggle etc
