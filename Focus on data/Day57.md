# Today I learned:

- I got a good refresh on initializing the view and returning the model container in the #Preview
- @Query is very good and flexible for filtering the objects properties mainly with #Predicate<Type>, then you can run a closure through that and run well ***almost*** normal swift code except it is a macro so it can lead to some unexpected results. I seen that sticking to less verbose code like logical operators seem like the less buggiest solution.
