# Today I learned:

- The differences between @Bindable and @Binding, **Bindable used for @Observable objects and Binding is for simple @State properties to pass data around**
- @AppStorage is great for storing simple information but not secure information
- TextEditor is great for allowing very big lines of text to be written in
- TextField with the .axis parameter passed will allow the text to expand vertically *(same functionality as TextEditor)* instead of having it keep expanding horizontally
- Finally I learned a lot about swiftdata stuff like @Model, .modelContainers and so much more
