# Today was a challenge and review day

- I completed the project 2 review of the concepts I learned this project
- I also completed the 3 challenges he gave me to add onto the existing project

Here were the challenges and they will be in my Project2

## Challenge

One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
2. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
3. Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

**Note:** That last one takes a little more thinking than the others. A good place to start would be to add a second alert() modifier watching a different Boolean property, then connect its button to a reset() method to set the game back to its initial state.

**I will admit for the note part I was a bit confused I didn't know if he wanted me to create my own reset button or swiftui comes built in with it but nonetheless I just manually reseted it for the user.**
