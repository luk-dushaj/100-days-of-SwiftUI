# What I learned today:

- The @State keyword to modify my properties in my struct
- Basic structure of a SwiftUI app
- NavigationStack view along with methods to modify it like .navigationTitle and .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode
- Section view to group related elements together
- Other views like Button, Text, TextField, Picker, Foreach, Form etc
