# Today was a Milestone day

Which what this day was I went over what I had just previously learned and reviewed some important concepts like structs vs classes etc

The instructor also assigned me a challenge to create a rock paper scissors app. 
I got most of the logic done today, he also said I can comeback and complete the challenges anytime I want.
So I probably will get it done whenever I have the time and just continue to the next day.
I will make sure to include that I got the project done in the commit description.
One last thing this rock paper scissors app will might go a bit above and beyond what the instructor said.
I just want this app to be of the best efforts since I am taking my time on it.
