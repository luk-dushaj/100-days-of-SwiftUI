# Today was a Milestone day

Which what this day was I went over what I had just previously learned and reviewed some important concepts like structs vs classes etc

The instructor also assigned me a challenge to create a rock paper scissors app. 
I got most of the logic done today, he also said I can comeback and complete the challenges anytime I want.
So I probably will get it done whenever I have the time and just continue to the next day.
I will make sure to include that I got the project done in the commit description.
