# Today I learned:

- Instructor went more in depth with Views/modifiers, modifier orders, what is behind the swiftui view (also there is nothing), why structs are used (performant/more simpler) and why swift uses "Some View" (which some is used because swift doesn't know the specific view).
- Conditional modifiers (applying ternary operator instead of if/else)
- Environment/regular modifiers
- Using views as properties
- View composition to break complex views into structs
- Then custom modifiers for more flexibility
