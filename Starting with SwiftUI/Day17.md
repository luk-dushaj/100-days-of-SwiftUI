# Today I learned:

- Paul (instructor) helped me make the WeSplit app *basically a app that you enter your total amount and tip percentage and it calculates then outputs the new total*
- @FocusState
- A lot more about modifiers especially the .toolbar one reminds me a bit of javascript with event handlers mainly in combination with the .focused one
- Overall this was more of a refinement to what yesterday is too because I am starting to at least know the possibilities of SwiftUI like:
```swift
Text(totalPerPerson, format: .currency (code:
                        Locale.current.currency?.identifier ?? "USD" ) )
```
I had no idea Text can take in this much arguments.
I know SwiftUI is composed of a lot of structs and methods but those structs are packed with a lot of features.
