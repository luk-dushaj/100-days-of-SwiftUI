# Today I learned:

- Different ways to arrangs views in a SwiftUI app like Vstack, Hstack and Zstack. With different ways of customizing them.
- Different colors and frames along with escaping the safe area also primary and secondary colors for dark mode of a app.
- A lot of gradients and cool blurring effects I can add onto my app. (I can specify as well for when the gradient should start/stop)
- I learned more on buttons/images especially when it comes to if the image is decorative or not along with apples built in system images. On buttons I learned a lot more on different ways to style/label one along with roles to a button like destructive/cancel.
