# 100-days-of-SwiftUI
This is a repo for me to share my progress into the course and for future references

## Notice:
Some days if I have time I will do **more days** in a single day based on the logs.
I am still technically following it by posting my progress and projects on here.
Each day will be a folder and have a markdown file of what I learned *(or just a markdown file itself)*.
