# Day 6

## What I learned:
I learned a lot this day basically all the loops:
While, for loops along with the break and continue statements.
For loops are pretty interesting in swift with I can leave the for loop variable blank with "_"
Also using the ..< is very cool to count up to a number but not through it.
