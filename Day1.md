# Day 1

## I learned:

The basics of variables *(let & var)* along with different data like strings, doubles and integers.
Also some handy methods for them like hasSuffix *(checks if a string contains a string in the beginning)*, hasSuffix *(same but with the ending)*, isMultiple *(retunrs a boolean if a number can be divided by that number)*
Lastly I learned multiline strings too
