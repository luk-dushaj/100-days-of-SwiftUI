# Day 7

## What I learned:
I learned a lot about functions, parameters, returns, a new data type (tuples), parameter labels.
Some specifics is the amount of customization I have with parameter labels like:
I can use a underscore before the label and with that when I pass a argument to my function I dont have to include the label with the value.
Also if I include a word before the label I now have two parameters a inside and a outside one.
The inside one is used for the logic inside of the function while the outside one is being used as the label to pass the value to the function.
Tuples are easier to access values compared to arrays/dictionaries with the dot notation.
Obviously I have learned more than this but I have to fully retain a lot of this information.
