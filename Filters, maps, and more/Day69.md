# Today I learned:

- Different map layouts and styles like .mapStyle and interactionModes:
- Map positioning with MapCameraPosition.region also can change position with @State
- .onMapCameraChange for getting data when user stops like you can get region, also .continious mode for all the time even the user isn't stopped
- How to make markers like making an array of a location type then ForEach them and all the marker view
- Instead of marker you can do Annotation which is more customizable
- I saw how MapReader workes for getting coordinates on .onTapGesture
- Added to build info on XCode for custom iOS properties which was Privacy - Face ID Usage Description
- How to check if device has Biometric authentication and to authenticate the user
- How to match face and activate it in the simulator
