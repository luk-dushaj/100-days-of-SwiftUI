# Today I learned:

- Besides the image type which I have to declare as optional, I learned about the 3 other powerful image types
- UIImage *Derived from UIKit with powerful functionality*, CGImage *basically a two dimension array of pixels*, CIImage *image recipe like to form one*
- All the image types are very interchangable when it comes to converting them
- A lot about filtering images and different kinds of filters/options
- The ContentUnavailable view and the different opions I have to display out to my user especially if I am having an error in my app or if there is a user error
